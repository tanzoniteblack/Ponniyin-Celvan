</td><td>Without being bothered one bit by their hold, he walked up a few steps saying, "Commander! You have come back at the right time. These knaves have not only stolen my clothes but they are also trying to kill me. Is this the way to treat guests? Is this the custom of Tanjore? I am not merely your guest. I am also a guest of the Emperor, you must have heard the words of the Empress! I am the messenger who brought letters from the Crown Prince. These fellows who treat me like this will not hesitate at anything. I am surprised that you keep such knaves as servants. In my Thondai country we would first hang such fellows and then do other things!" He did not stop the tirade.

</td><td>Accordingly, Vandiya Devan searched carefully. He found more gold coins than what he originally had in his waist pouch. The letter meant for Kundavai Devi was also there. How did these extra gold coins come here? How did the letter which he had not found on his previous search come back? The letter must have fallen in the hands of the Commander of Tanjore. He must have read it and put it back in the waist pouch when he came back now. Why has he done this? Why has he placed the extra gold coins in here? He is a very dangerous fellow. In what other manner will he examine me, I wonder! I must be very careful in dealing with him!
