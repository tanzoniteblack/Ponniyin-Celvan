</td><td>In that morning hour, various people -- vendors of milk, curds and other dairy products, fruit and vegetable sellers, butchers, farmers, others engaged in various trades, clerks and accountants, petty officials and others -- were trying to enter the fort. The officious gatekeepers were letting them in, one by one, through a small wicket gate placed on one of the big doors. The guards stood around with cocky insolence.

</td><td>Kanchi City (from where he came) was the capital of the ancient Pallava Empire. It had withstood the attack of several enemies. The buildings, mansions and palaces in that city were now badly maintained, dilapidated ruins. Of course many of them were well sculpted, architecturally beautiful. But several parts of that city were in ruins. After Aditya Karikala took over, he had renovated some of the public buildings and palaces. These new structures looked like isolated sprigs of fresh shoots on a dying tree. In facts they made the dilapidation more obvious. But this Tanjore!?

</td><td>Tanjore was quite the opposite thing. Everything looked new. New palaces, new buildings, new temples. The white-washed mansions interspersed with buildings of brick baked of red earth shone like some jewel, set with a cluster of rubies enhanced by pearls and diamonds. Trees in the gardens and by the roadside had grown luxuriously tall, nourished by that fertile red-dust. Coconut and areca nut palms; ashoka cypress, laurels, spreading banyan, fig and sacred ficus; jack, mango and neem -- they painted a picture of varying hues of emerald. That greenery was pleasing to the eye and joyous to the heart. A new city built by an architect of illusion. I feel new excitement when I enter this new city; my heart fills with unexplainable pride!

</td><td>Vandiya Devan who had seen the fuss and fret in letting people enter inside had surmised that the inner city would be empty. But it was quite contrary: all the streets were crowded with hustle and bustle. Horses, and chariots yoked with horses rushed past noisily. Bells -- tied around the necks of elephants which walked slowly, gracefully like tiny, black, moving hillocks -- tinkled all around. Vendors selling flowers, fruit, milk, fish and other edibles called out their wares and raised a huge din. Huge drums boomed and large bells tolled periodically announcing the passing hours. The gentle breeze carried the melody of musical instruments and voices of young men and women raised in song. Everything was festive like one big carnival.

</td><td>Vandiya Devan did not wish to let anyone know that he was a newcomer to that exquisite city. If he asked the way of anyone they would look him up and down and ask arrogantly, "Are you new to this town?" -- They may even think him to be an uncivilized villager if he asked the way to the royal palace. Therefore, he should somehow find his way without asking anyone and reach the palace. It may not be difficult.

</td><td>Wherever he looked he could see mansions festooned with bunting and crowned by high flying pennants and flags. The flags fought the swift breeze and raised a "Chat, pat" noise. Tiger-flags and palmtree- flags were more profuse. He saw one huge flag emblazoned with a rampant tiger, flying sky high, rising above all the others. That must be the Emperor's palace, thought Vandiya Devan Vallavarayan as he began walking in that direction. He thought of what he must do next.

</td><td>The first, important task is to present myself to the Emperor and personally deliver the letter and the verbal messages conveyed by Prince Aditya. It may not be possible to see the Emperor without the Younger Lord Pazluvoor's permission. How can I obtain that permission? God helped me enter the fort. But, can I be complacent, thinking that God's grace will aid me till the end? I must connive something to manage entry into the palace to meet the Emperor. What is the strategy to adopt? Oh my clever brain! Descendant of generations of illustrious Vaanar's! Think of something! Polish up your imagination. Get to work! Imagination is essential; not just for writers and poets. Fellows like me entangled in such political turmoil also need plenty of imagination. Let me think...

What a wonderful building. A palace comparable to that of the King of Gods; a palace like that of legendary Vikramaditya of Ujjain! How exquisite is the carving on these portals? The horses with raised forelegs, carved on the pillars, seem to be ready to leap forward!

</td><td>Several roads from all directions came to meet in a large plaza in front of that palace. At the head of each of these streets two horsemen and two footmen stood guard. People walking about the streets turned back without coming near them. Some persons stood near them to stare at the palace portal and the big flag before they turned back. If the people crowded around too long, the guards made signs to disperse them. Even those who gathered in groups talked softly, whispering to each other.

They were dressed in pearl necklaces, golden anklets and eardrops. Some had adorned their forehead with horizontal ashen lines.

He quietly mingled into that group of poets.
