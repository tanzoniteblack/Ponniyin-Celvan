</td><td>When the Elder Lord Pazluvoor finally returned to his palace, it was well past midnight. The storm in his heart raised more dust than a swift breeze that blew upon a dusty field swirling the dust again and again. He was slightly sorry for having been so harsh with his dear brother. There was no measure to the affection that his younger brother showered upon him.

</td><td>He said something because of his affection for me. But still, a suspicious fellow! Why must he unnecessarily find fault with Nandini? It must be human nature. It is natural that one should try to escape the consequences of ones own mistakes by throwing the blame on someone else. But, why does he stoop to that lowly practice? Is it commendable of him and his courage to let go of the culprit in his hands and then blame a woman, that too his own sister-in-law? It's alright! He did beg forgiveness for his words. Why should I keep thinking of it?

</td><td>Nevertheless, could there be some atom of truth in his words? Perhaps in my old age I am enslaved by a madness for womankind? For the sake of some female whom I picked up on the wayside, I had to be harsh with my dear brother who stood beside me in several battles; a brother who has guarded me with his very life! Anyway what is so great about her? I have no idea of her antecedents. Her behavior and talk often raise suspicions. Damn it! My brother's words have raised confusion even in my mind!

</td><td>How unjustified? She loves me dearly; she behaves with such reverence towards me! Such enthusiasm she has, about my affairs. Sometimes she even gives me great ideas! Must I not consider her courage in marrying this sixty-six year old-man? Her beauty would evoke the jealousy of even divine nymphs -- if one were to hold a competition for her hand, even the king of the heavens would come running ... Which king on this earth will not covet her? Ah! If this fellow Sundara Chozla had only seen her! Why should I doubt such a person?

</td><td>I have heard that old men who marry very young girls give in to useless doubts and worries, making their lives hell. I have seen such instances. Should I subject myself to such mockery? Even so, I must find out certain truths from her. She often borrows the signet ring. Why? She goes and sits alone in the gazebo, why does she do that? I hear rumors that some sorcerer visits her frequently; in fact she herself agreed to it -- but why? What does she have to ask a sorcerer or magician? Who does she have to seduce with sorcery? And apart from all this, what about this fate of mine: how long do I have to remain like this, a celibate bachelor ever after the wedding? She keeps putting me off by talking about some vow or penance -- never explaining what the vow is or what the penance is about. Her methods seem like the tricks of some cunning heroine in a fable! I must not let this continue! Tonight I must talk firmly about it and decide once for all.

His searching eyes did not find the Young-Queen whom he was eager to see! Upon query, he found that she was still in the garden gazebo. What is she doing out there after midnight? he wondered if she was being indifferent. He walked down to the garden with some rage.

The tiny thorn which hurts your small foot will achieve that which could not be done in several battles by swords and arrows. How can I take you to the battlefield? Even this -- you standing here on this granite walkway -- hurts me! Come here, come and sit on you flower laden couch! Let me gaze upon your divine face. You think that this parting of four days was difficult only for you? Every second away from you was like an eon for me! At least now, let me look at your face and satisfy my longing."

I can give her all the three worlds for such a smile! I don't posses all the three worlds, so let me offer my life, my soul all my possessions to her! But she does not ask anything of me! So ran the thoughts in that powerful chieftain's mind.
