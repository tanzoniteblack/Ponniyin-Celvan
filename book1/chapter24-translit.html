</td><td>Vandiya Devan slept through the night like a log and woke up only after sunrise in the morning. Even after waking, he was lying down without the will to get up. The light breeze blew briskly, leaves of the creepers and trees rubbed against each other making a swishing murmur. With that background drone, a young voice was melodiously singing a pleasing Thevaram poem composed by the Saint Sundara Murti.

</td><td>On hearing the song, Vandiya Devan opened his eyes and looked out. Outside, in the garden he saw tall konnai trees (the bignonia family) draped with wreaths of golden yellow flowers! Sendan Amudan held a large flower tote in one hand and a long bamboo pole in the other. While he sang, his hands plucked the yellow flowers with the harvest pole. He appeared neatly dressed, having risen and bathed early, his forehead was adorned with broad ashen marks making him appear like another ever youthful Markandeya, that ardent devotee of Shiva.

</td><td>Vandiya Devan rose from his bed thinking about Amudan's unfortunate mother who could not hear the melodious song of her son. He wondered why he too should not cultivate a pleasant garden, serve in temples and lead a calm and quiet life. Why should he bear sword and spear and wander from place to place? Why should he roam about in readiness to kill or be killed by others? -- such thoughts jostled his mind.

</td><td>But soon, his heart cheered up. Can everyone in the world be meek and gentle like Sendan Amudan? There are many who are thieves, robbers, and conniving evil-doers who harm the guileless folk. A government was needed to control such people and establish some law and order. Kings and ministers were essential to form such governments. Velaikara Battalions were essential to protect such kings. Messengers like himself to carry letters to such kings were also needed... Yes, today I must somehow or other meet Emperor Sundara Chozla. I must present myself before the Elder Lord of Pazluvoor returns; if the old man gets back I may not have an opportunity.

</td><td>Vandiya Devan went to the lotus pond in the garden for a swim and bath. He came back refreshed and dressed himself neatly with clean cloth and correct ornaments. He was going to present himself to the Emperor -- shouldn't he be attired properly? Perhaps it was that thought that made him dress carefully; or, maybe it was the idea that he was soon going to see the Young-Queen of Pazluvoor once again, which occupied his thoughts! None can tell.

In the nights he lights the fire atop the tower and is in charge of other such things. He has one son and one daughter. That daughter, ..." Amudan hesitated.

But, it is said that some of the men loyal to Veera-pandiya have sworn vengeance; they conspire together. The Lords of Pazluvoor felt that they would not be able to guard the Emperor from such assassins at Pazlayarai. They asked him to move to Tanjore. The fortress here is stronger. Its guard and safety is more efficient. Besides, the doctors felt that Tanjore was a better place than Pazlayarai to treat the Emperor's illness."
