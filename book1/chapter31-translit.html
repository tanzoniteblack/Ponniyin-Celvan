</td><td>Our gallant Vandiya Devan looked at the portraits of the Chozla monarchs beginning from Vijayala to Paranthaka II Sundara Chozla and enjoyed them.

</td><td>Ah! How capable each of them was! What brave men! What great deeds they accomplished, considering their very lives to be trivial! I have not read about such people even in the stories and epics! Surely, this Chozla nation is fortunate to have such a ruling dynasty and all the territories under the sway of their empire are truly fortunate!

</td><td>Vandiya Devan noticed another important fact in the history of the above Chozla monarchs: every Chozla king was helped considerably by a chieftain of the Pazluvoor clan. The chieftains had performed several deeds of bravery while helping their kings.

</td><td>During the siege of Tanjore, when it was under the control of the Muthu-arayas, it was a Pazluvoor chief who first entered the conquered fort. When the lame warrior Vijayala entered the battlefield at Thiru-puram-biyam, it was a scion of the clan of Pazluvoor who lent him his shoulders to carry him to the front. It was another chief of Pazluvoor who placed the golden crown upon Aditya's head and anointed him as an independent king. He was the same Lord Pazluvoor who lent his shoulders for Aditya to step on and jump upon the war elephant to kill the Pallava Aparajita. The chieftains of Pazluvoor had carried the tiger-flag and led the victorious Chozla armies in the various campaigns of Emperor Paranthaka I. A Lord Pazluvoor had picked up Raja-aditya who lay slain in the battlefield; shouting "The Rashtrakuta's are thwarted!" he turned the defeat into victory. The present day chieftains had similarly served Arinjaya and Sundara Chozla in various ways.

</td><td>Vandiya Devan who saw all these incidents depicted in the art gallery was immersed in boundless surprise. He realized that there was justification in the present Lords of Pazluvoor, the two brothers, enjoying such prestige and authority in the Chozla Empire. There was nothing remarkable in Sundara Chozla consulting their opinion in every matter of state.

</td><td>But, I am now caught in a huge dilemma; that much is sure. The Commander feels some suspicion about me for some reason. If the Elder Lord returns, the suspicions will be confirmed. The truth about the signet ring will be unveiled and after that my situation will become defenseless! He had heard details about the infamous dungeons -- Tanjore Prisons -- under the supervision of the Younger Lord Pazluvoor.

</td><td>He even gave up his wish to meet the Young-Queen of Pazluvoor once again. All that he wanted was to escape from the terrible fate of the dungeons, save his life and get away from the fort. Even if I don't have the letter, I can meet the Princess Kundavai personally and explain things to her. It's fine if she believes me; if not, it cannot be helped. But how am I to get out of this fort?

</td><td>Suddenly he began to wonder about the old clothes he had worn in the morning. What could have happened to them? They gave me all these new garments and showed me consideration just to examine my old clothes! The letter to Kundavai must have fallen in the Commander's hands. There is no doubt about that now! I now understand why he caught hold of me in that vise-like grip and did not let me leave with the bards. That is why he sent, not one but three men to serve me here. Ah! What can I do? Some strategy, some trick is needed! I must find a way before the Elder returns. Yes an idea occurs to me ... let me try it ... I must not hesitate any more ... thought Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan.

</td><td>"Thieving knaves! Are you playing tricks with me? Here, I will report you to your master!" saying this Vandiya Devan tried to cross the doorstep. One of the three men came forward to block his way. Vandiya Devan bunched his right fist and delivered a well placed hit upon the fellow's nose! That was it; the fellow toppled to fall heavily to the ground. Blood began gushing out of his nose.

Vandiya Devan caught hold of both the outstretched arms; he thrust his foot between the legs of the enemy and gave a sudden twist... .. then ... the fellow sat down shouting painfully "Ammma...!" The third man had come closer by now. Vandiya Devan stepped aside and kicked with his left leg, aiming at the knee cap of the man. He too fell roaring with pain! None of them had expected this sudden attack!
