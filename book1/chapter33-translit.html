</td><td>Vandiya Devan departed for sight-seeing in Tanjore, with the two men sent by the Commander following him on both sides. He had no doubt about the fact that they followed him to prevent his escape. Surely, orders would have been given to stop him if tried leaving the fort by the gates.

</td><td>It is not a big deal to escape from these two men ... I can attack suddenly and overpower them and then run away. But where can I run away? The whole world knows how well fortified this fort is, under the guard of the Lords of Pazluvoor. People say that even the breeze cannot enter without their permission. This morning, the Emperor himself declared that even death cannot enter! How am I to escape from such a fortress?

</td><td>I must handle these two louts; they may immediately start shouting for help. The next instant, I may be thrown in the underground prison. Or, I may loose my life. There is no use in attacking these two men. Not attack, but trickery is needed for escape. After I am free of these men I must ponder about a way to get out of the fort. However strong the fortification, it must surely have some secret outlets or underground passages. How am I to find one such passage? Who will know about it? Even if they know will they let me into the secret?

</td><td>Thinking various such thoughts he walked around. Suddenly he recalled the Young-Queen of Pazluvoor. Ah! If anyone would help me in this fort it is likely that she would! Even that is doubtful... But I can try some hoax in the name of Azlvar-adiyan Nambi. If I am to meet her, I must first find out the whereabouts of the palace of the Elder Lord Pazluvoor. Even if I find the palace these louts must not know that I am meeting the Young-Queen. If they know, they will report the incident to their master. Who knows the consequences of that? Moreover, what will happen if the Elder Lord returns when I am inside his palace? It will be like deliberately thrusting one's head into the lion's cave.

"What is this tower?" His ears were eager to hear something like "That is the mansion of Lord Pazluvoor" or "It is the Young-Queen of Pazluvoor's mansion" -- but nothing like that was said. His eyes searched and noted details in all directions.

</td><td>As usual, he looked at his guides and asked, "What is this crowd?" They replied, "Velaikara Battalion of Velirs." He showed an eagerness to learn more details of that battalion. He declared that he too wished to enlist into such a brave battalion, therefore he wished to examine the procession more closely. While conversing in this fashion he had approached the marching men. Declaring a wish to look at the men in the front who were beating the kettle drums he quickly mingled into the procession.

</td><td>Vallavarayan noticed the episode. He made up his mind in one second! We already know that determination and execution are one and the same to our hero. So, with shouts of "Go", "Catch", he too began following the other two men -- running into the alley behind them. The milkmaid ran into an alley and turned into a tiny by-lane. When the men following her turned into the path, she had disappeared. The man chasing her, now gave up. He and his friends turned back to rejoin the parade. But Vandiya Devan did not turn back. He ran further into the by-lanes and alleyways leading off it. He ran down a few such streets and then slowed down to a steady walk.

In one street he noticed towering walls enclosing both sides. Tall fences abutted the street in some parts. Thicket fences hid the grounds beyond the street in some places. Vandiya Devan kept walking without stopping anywhere, unconcerned about the direction.

By now the men would have gone back to report to their master. The Commander would have sent his men in all directions in search of me. Perhaps he will suspect that I have escaped and gone outside with the parade of the Velir men. They will search for me inside as well as outside the fort. Let them search; search very well. If I don't fool all those men and escape from this fortress, my name is not Vallavarayan of Vaanar family.

</td><td>When he woke up after some hours, he saw that the moon was riding the low skies. Moonlight filtered through the leaves of the thick trees and cast shadows on the ground. He could make out the outlines of the buildings around him. He tried to recall his situation. He was incredulous about having fallen asleep like that. Even more, he was astonished at awakening suddenly like that. What was that noise that woke him? Some voice had called to him ... Was it human or was it the call of some beast? Or was it the call of some night bird that startled him? -- Did he really hear something?
