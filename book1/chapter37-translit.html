</td><td>The people of Tanjore had a special affection for the two brothers of Pazluvoor. Were not the Lords of Pazluvoor the ones who brought a new prominence and prestige to that old city?

</td><td>Tanjore folk always enjoyed parades of elephants, horses, camels and footmen. That too if the Elder Lord Pazluvoor, the Officer of Finance, left the fortress of Tanjore or reentered it, the people would gather to stand on both sides of the street to watch, to cheer and praise. Oftentimes they would shower flower petals along with their well wishes.

</td><td>Some persons compared the two brothers of Pazluvoor to the demon kings of myth -- Hiranya-aksha and Hiranya-kasipu; others referred to them as the brothers Sunda and Upasunda of the fable. They had been compared to the ideal brothers Rama and Bharata (of the epic Ramayana); or to those best among brothers, Arjuna and Bhima (of the other epic Mahabarata).

In fact there was not much of a crowd. The Younger Lord Pazluvoor had not come to wait outside the fortress gates to welcome his brother.

</td><td>"The affair on which I ventured was completely successful. All the persons invited had come to Kadamboor. All of them unanimously agreed that your son-in-law Madurandaka is the rightful heir to the throne. They approved with cheers. All of them are ready to establish the right, with swords if need arises and if justice is not obtained. There can be no obstruction to our intentions. Even Kolli Mazlava-raya and Munai-raya agreed. Sambuvaraya is ready to extend the use of all his resources, his fortress, forces everything for this cause. His son Kandamaran is even more eager. We don't have to worry about the central provinces or Thiru-munai-padi. Chozla lands are now under our control. Why think of anything else? The only three persons who may oppose us are Thiru-kovalur Malayaman, Pallava Parthiban and Kodumbalur Velir. Amongst them, the Kodumbalur fellow is not here; he is in Lanka. What can the other two do? We have to disclose everything to the Emperor, very soon, and come to a decision." Lord Pazluvoor spoke with enthusiasm.

</td><td>"Ah! Who is going to ask the people? Are all affairs of state conducted with the approval of the people? If the people are emboldened to object, we should ensure that they do not interfere in such things anymore. I don't think anything like that will occur. If we declare it as the Emperor's wish, they will keep quiet. Moreover, fortunately Arulmozli is in Lanka. If he is here the people may try to demonstrate their blind loyalty. People do not have any such fondness for Aditya Karikala. It is easy to turn their loyalty towards Madurandaka. He already has a name for being `Religious' and `Good natured'. You know that your son-in-law has a more charismatic face than even the sons of Sundara Chozla? It would be surprising if the witless people who consider that `Inner beauty reflects on the face' do not start cheering `Long live Madurandaka'. Whatever happens why do you worry when I am here?" spoke the Elder Lord Pazluvoor.
