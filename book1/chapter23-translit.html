</td><td>The Velaikara Battalion wound its way through the main market street. Some of the men walking towards the end of the parade performed certain audacities in that marketplace. One fellow entered the shop of a food vendor and carried out a basket of sweet-cakes; he distributed the cakes to his friends. When he crowned the vendor with the upturned empty basket, all his friends laughed uproariously "Ha ha ha haha ha."

</td><td>Another gallant fellow plucked the flower tote from the hands of an elderly woman. Scattering the flowers in all directions he shouted "Hey friends, its raining flowers!" Two soldiers trying to catch the flowers shouted gleefully and raised a hue and cry! Yet another fellow stopped a bullock cart on the road and unyoked the beast from the cart; he drove the animal into the crowd by twisting its tail; the terrified animal ran helter skelter in the crowd, plunging against innocent bystanders. Gleeful laughter followed this endeavor!

How fortunate that I escaped their sight by standing aside. Otherwise, a little conflict would have taken place! My venture would have been wrecked, he thought. But one difference was obvious to him. The people on these streets did not resent these activities of the Velir men very much. Some of them even joined in their pranks and enjoyed the merriment and laughter.

His horse, which had crossed several leagues that day was very tired. Soon he must give it some rest. Otherwise, tomorrow, when the need arose the horse may become useless. He must soon find a comfortable place to spend the night.

</td><td>All the streets were noisy with crowds of people. Travellers from far and near, who had come to the city on various businesses walked here and there. People from other Chozla cities and countryside were there. Persons from nations taken into the Chozla fold recently were also there. Several folks crowded to that capital city from nations spreading across the lands between the North Pennar river and the southern Cape, and between the eastern seas and the western ocean. In that crowd he could also spot foreigners, dressed curiously from the distant lands beyond the Vindhyas and across the seas.

Fruits like banana, mango and jack were heaped in mounds outside the shops. Words were not adequate to describe the elegant flower kiosks. Gardenia and jasmine, fragrant frangipani, oleander, chrysanthemum and marigold, champaka and iruvatchi, hibiscus and trumpet lilies were heaped in baskets; maidens flocked around them like bees buzzing over flower groves.

Perhaps he would have helped me find a comfortable place to spend this night in this city... As he was thinking, as if to give life to his thoughts, he saw the youth walking down the street in front of him. Vandiya Devan hurried forward to accost him again.

Vandiya Devan felt that he had not eaten such delicacies in his lifetime! He ate about ten or twelve cakes and drank a liter of coconut milk. Sour sauce with tubers and steamed millet flour followed. He did them justice. Even so, his hunger was not satiated. In the end he partook of a quarter measure of cooked rice and a liter of yogurt! Only then did he rise from his platter.

Soldiers guarding the fort of Tanjore under the command of the Younger Lord Pazluvoor, lived inside with their families.

</td><td>Besides this, the streets of the goldsmiths, silversmiths, jewelers and dealers in precious gems and coin merchants were inside the main fort. Hundreds of clerks and writers working for the Tax Ministry under the Elder Lord Pazluvoor were also provided accommodation within. In addition to all this, the famous Temple of the Goddess Durga Nisumbasudhini was in one corner of the interior fort. The temple priests, servants, dancing girls and musicians attached to the temple and their families, lived inside near the temple.

</td><td>"How can everyone be inside? They will be going out and coming back in the course of their various duties. For sometime now, the Honorable Prime Minister, Anirudda Brahma-raya, has not been inside the fort. It is said that he is gone to the Chera Kingdom. The Elder Lord of Pazluvoor went out four days ago. Rumor says that he has gone to the central provinces beyond the Kollidam."

</td><td>Vandiya Devan desired to learn of several other things from Sendan Amudan. But he did not wish to pry too much and raise his suspicions. The friendship of such a amiable youth would be very useful to him. It was his good luck that he found such a convenient and comfortable place to stay in Tanjore. Why should he spoil the good fortune? Moreover, tiredness of the long journey joined forces with the sleeplessness of the previous night. His eyes were drowsy with sleep and exhaustion. Realizing his state, Amudan quickly made up a bed for him.

</td><td>As a child, once when he was walking through some woods he suddenly spied a cobra swaying its raised hood. Its beauty was incomparable. The attraction was beyond description. Vandiya Devan had not been able to take his eyes off the swaying hood of the snake. He could not even blink his eyelids. He stood there as if hypnotized; the snake continued its swaying dance. As the snake swayed, his body began to sway in rhythm -- what would be the result, no one knew. Suddenly a mongoose pounced upon the snake. A furious contest between the two started. Using the chance the boy ran to his escape...

</td><td>Dear me! What a comparison! How can I equate the majestic beauty of this maid without equal in the world, with a swaying snake? Her gentle, tender face will quell all hungers of those who catch a glimpse of it! ... I am going to meet her tomorrow! How sweet her voice! Her beauty is extraordinary. But, how about the other maid whom I saw at the astrologer's house and on the banks of the Arisil? ... Her face too, was radiant. It too glowed with a loveliness. Both are exquisite beauties; but what a difference! That has dignity and decorum; while this has allure and glamour.
