</td><td>It was a practice among the Tamils of the ancient times to erect a hero stone and raise a memorial for great warriors who died bravely in the battlefield. If the memorial was marked merely by a stone tablet the place was known as the stone monument of the warrior. If a statue of a divinity was consecrated along with the marker, the place came to be called a palli padai or memorial shrine and temple.

</td><td>One such memorial-temple existed near the village of Thiru-puram-biyam, on the northern banks of the River Manni about half a league from Kudanthai. It had been erected in memory of a great warrior, the Ganga King Prithvi-pathi who had died in a great battle near that village.

</td><td>Those who read world history may recall that the great battles of Waterloo and Panipat changed the very course of history. The battle of Thiru-puram-biyam had a similar significance with regard to South Indian history. That battle took place in the year AD 885, about a hundred years before the times of our story. It is essential that all persons interested in the history of the Tamils should know the details of that battle.

</td><td>The early Chozla kings of the Sangam Age -- Karikala Valava, Ilan-chet-chenni, Perunar-killi, Thodi-thot Sembiyan -- ruled with great fame and prosperity. For about five to six hundred years after their times, a long eclipse clouded the fame of the Chozla's. The Pandiyas in the south and the Pallavas of the north squashed the Chozlas into becoming petty chieftains. Towards the end, the Chozlas had to give up their coveted capital city, Uraiyoor, to the Pandiyas and move east. The Chozla chieftains who moved east made Pazlayarai, near Kudanthai, their new capital. But they did not forget their rights to their long time capital, i.e., Uraiyoor. Neither did they give up their title of Rooster Kings -- a title of monarchs who ruled from Uraiyoor which was also known as Kozliyoor (kozli in Tamil means rooster.)

</td><td>At that time the enmity between the Pandiyas and Pallavas had grown to result in several skirmishes and fights. The Pandiya king of that time was Varaguna. The Pallava monarch was Aparajita. The battles between these two powerful rulers often took place on Chozla territory! Just like the rooster caught in the midst of a clash between one elephant and another, the Chozla people suffered: caught in the midst of the enmity of two super-powers.

The armed strength of both sides was more or less equal. Pallava Aparajita was supported by the Ganga King Prithvi-pathi. Aditya Chozla also supported Aparajita.

But Aditya knew that if the Pandiyas were victorious this time, the Chozlas would be totally destroyed. Therefore, like the Cauvery mixing into the mighty ocean, his tiny army joined the larger Pallava forces.

</td><td>The battlefield spread across one square league. The four divisions of the army -- chariot legions, elephant brigade, cavalry and infantry were ready. When elephant clashed with elephant, like two mountains hurled against each other, the skies thundered. Horses flew against horses like furious storms thrown one against the other; lances and long spears held by the horsemen shone like lightning. Chariot dashed against chariot: broken into smithereens and thrown in all directions. The noise of the whistling arrows and clashing swords filled the skies and shook the four corners of the world.

</td><td>After the first three days of battle, a very tiny battalion of the Pallavas remained intact. Those men who lived were very tired. But Pandiya forces attacked again and again as if they owned some divine spell against tiredness. A council-of-war was held in King Aparajita's tent. The three kings -- Aparajita, Prithvi-pathi and Aditya together with their generals, met to discuss further action. They decided that they could no longer oppose the enemy; it was best to retreat to the north of the Kollidam.

</td><td>At that point a miracle happened in the battlefield. Vijayala Chozla -- weak with old age, bearing numberless war-scars over his body, having lost the power to use his legs because of wounds -- somehow came to the battle front. The old war-lion realized that if the Pallava forces withdrew beyond the Kollidam, the Chozla entity would be completely wiped out. His roar instilled new life in the remaining Pallava men.

In the course of time, no one went near that temple. Over the years the building began to crumble. Soon it turned into ruins.

He then hid himself carefully amidst the branches of a tree that covered the roof. He kept watch in all directions. Soon, his eyes were able to peer into the darkness and discern various shapes. His ears were able to hear even the tiniest of noises.

</td><td>"Oh! My dear star friends! Today you seem to be laughing at the foolishness of these human beings on this earth. You have good reason to laugh! You might remember that horrible battle which took place in this very spot a hundred years ago; and how the whole area was a wretched ruin of blood and death. Perhaps you were surprised at mankind and their petty enmities! You wondered why they butchered each other to create rivers of red. It is called bravery!

They are going to meet near the enemy memorial and talk and conspire of more harm to the living in the name of the dead! Oh you twinkling lights of the skies! Why won't you laugh? Yes. Laugh as much as you wish.

Or did those men who made the sign of the fish change their plans and go some place else? -- What disappointment? Disappointment? I cannot forgive myself if I am cheated today... Ah! ... I think I can see some light in that direction. What is it? The light is now hidden. No. I can see it. No doubt now. Someone is coming here; he is holding a torch of burning twigs. No, not one man -- I hear two men. My waiting has not been wasted."

</td><td>The two men who came crossed the path and went beyond the memorial temple. They stopped in the midst of a small clearing nearby. One fellow sat down. The man holding the lighted twigs looked around. There was no doubt: he was expecting some others. After sometime, two others came and joined them. They must have been very brave men; men who had come to that spot several times before. Otherwise, they could not have found their way in that darkness in that forest.

</td><td>They started talking amongst themselves, softly. Azlvar-adiyan felt that it was a waste to sit on top of that roof without hearing anything. He must get down and go near the clearing to listen to their talk. He must manage to avoid the danger from such activity. Azlvar-adiyan started down from the roof top. His stocky body disturbed the tree branches and made a slight noise.
