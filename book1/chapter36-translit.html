No final rites according to the sacred texts were offered and no priest officiated. They had built the pyre with dried leaves and deadwood from the forest. They threw a body hidden behind trees onto that pyre. Then they set fire to it. The dry wood of the forest caught fire easily and burned bright.

Though your limbs and mouth were bound, your eyes and ears were free. So, you watched and listened. After they had all sworn their oaths, the men approached you again. You, who were quiet till then, tried to make some signs -- trying to free your hands from the rope, rolling your ravishing eyes. One of the men noticed, `She seems to wish to say something,' he said. `Must be the old story, throw her into the fire,' said another. `Wait, before we throw her into the fire, let us at least hear what she wants; remove the cloth from her mouth,' spoke a third fellow. Because he was their leader, the other men removed the cloth stuffed into your mouth. Do you remember the words you said at that time?" asked Ravidasa and then stopped.
