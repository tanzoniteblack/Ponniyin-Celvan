(Note: The eight letter word is the name of Vishnu -- na-mo-sri-na-ra-ya-na-ya -- worshipped by the Vaishnava sect; the five letter word -- na-ma-si-va-ya -- denotes Shiva worshipped by the Saiva sect.)

</td><td>Azlvar-adiyan looked at Vandiya Devan and asked, "Thambi, you ask that fanatic Saiva fellow. He is in such agony when he merely hears God's name! Does not this river Kollidam wash the lotus feet of God Narayana who reposes in Srirangam and then come down here? Is it not because these waters, which have touched the feet of Narayana, have become hallowed, that Shiva performs penance while immersed in these waters at Thiru-anai-kava?" Before he could conclude this long story, the Saiva zealot became very furious and rushed towards the equally fanatic Vaishnava Nambi. Since both entered into a fist fight at one end of the boat, it seemed as if the ferry-boat would soon capsize! One of the men and Vandiya Devan intervened and separated them.

</td><td>In the ancient Tamil land, for almost six hundred years, (up till about the tenth century AD) the religions of Buddhism and Jainism held prestigious sway. Because of these religions, the Tamil land gained several advantages. Sculpture, painting, poetry, literature and other such arts were nurtured and developed. Emphasis was on Sanskrit. Later the Azlvar's (Vaishnava saints) and Nayanmar's (Saiva saints) appeared. They sang melodious poems -- devotional songs in nectar-sweet, divine Tamil. They fostered and developed the Vaishnava (of Vishnu) and Saiva (of Shiva) sects of Hinduism. Their preaching was quite powerful. They utilized the power of art, sculpture and music for their missionary work. Several others set their songs to divine music and sang them. Those who listened to these musical poems were enticed, enamored and subject to fanatic devotion. The Shiva and Vishnu temple-towns mentioned in such devotional songs acquired new merit and fresh holiness. Temples, which till then were built with wood and brick, were renovated and rebuilt with stone and sculpture. Such holy renovation-works were undertaken even since Vijayala Chozla's times by the Chozla monarchs and members of their family as well as other nobility.

</td><td>At about the same time an important event occurred in the Kerala nation. A great soul was born in the village of Kaladi. At a very young age he gave up worldly pleasures and became an ascetic. He studied all the sciences and literature in the northern language (Sanskrit) and became an expert. He then established the foundation for the Advaita philosophy, based on the principles gained from the Hindu scriptures -- Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavat Gita and Brahma Sutras because of his expertise in Sanskrit. He, Sankara the Teacher, traveled all over the Indian sub-continent and established eight religious-seats for propagating Advaita philosophy. Ascetics who espoused his philosophy spread his word all over the country. (Advaita meaning non-dual, advocates the non-dual nature of existence; that God is only one; and that God and man are one and the same.)

</td><td>Thus, in the Tamil lands, during the times of our story (tenth century AD) there was a great religious revival and awakening. Certain harmful consequences, arising out of this revival, also spread throughout the countryside. Fanatic Shiva devotees and fanatic Vishnu devotees rose here and there. They entered into fights wherever they met each other. Sometimes, Advaita philosophers also entered into these disputes. Wordy duels often turned into fistfights and brawls.

</td><td>There is an interesting story that reveals the extent of this rivalry between the religious sects of those times. A man from Srirangam, of the Vaishnava sect, was once walking along the outer walls of the Shiva temple at Thiru-anai-kava. Suddenly a stone hit his head. He was wounded and bleeding. The Vaishnava man looked up towards the sky. He saw a crow sitting atop the old temple tower and surmised that a piece of brick from the dilapidated spire dislodged by the crow must have fallen on his head. Immediately he forgot his wound and pain and became quite delighted. He said, "Oh you devout Vaishnava crow from Srirangam! Good that you are demolishing this Shiva temple completely!"

Several kinds of birds roosting in the thick, leafy branches of that wide-spreading, large tree raised a pleasing musical sound.

</td><td>Azlvar-adiyan Nambi was born in a village on the banks of the River Vaigai, in the Pandiya Kingdom. All his family were ardent Vaishnava devotees. One day, his father was walking in the gardens along the river bank when he found an orphan baby girl who was abandoned in the garden. He brought the infant home. Because the child was very attractive and beautiful, all the members of his family loved and nourished her. Since the child was found in a garden (nandavan), they named her Nandini. Nambi, considering her a younger sister, loved and cherished her.

</td><td>As Nandini grew in years, her devotion to God Vishnu also grew. All the people around them believed that she would become another Andal (Vaishnava saint) to captivate all their hearts. Azlvar-adiyan believed it more than anyone else. After his father's death, he took up the responsibility of raising that girl. The two of them travelled from one town to another, singing Vaishnava poems and spreading the belief in devotion to Vishnu. People who heard Nandini, wearing basil-leaf garlands and singing the psalms of the Azlvar saints, were enchanted.

</td><td>The final great-battle between the Chozla and Pandiya kings was fought near Madurai City. The Pandiya armies were totally destroyed. King Veera-pandiya had fallen in the battlefield with wounds all over his body. Some of his personal servants found him: they tried to revive him and save his life; they brought him away from the battlefield and into the house of Nandini which was nearby. Nandini, upon seeing the condition of the Pandiya king, was filled with pity and she nursed him in the sickbed. However, the Chozla soldiers soon found this out. They surrounded Nandini's house, entered inside and killed Veera-pandiya. Lord Pazluvoor, captivated by the beauty of Nandini whom he found there, imprisoned her and took her away with him.

</td><td>Upon hearing this tale, Vandiya Devan's heart was touched. For a second, he considered telling Nambi that the person inside the covered palanquin in Kadamboor was not Nandini; that it was Prince Madurandaka. Something in his heart prevented him. Perhaps all this tale was the fertile imagination of Azlvar-adiyan. Therefore, he did not reveal the secrets he had learned at the Kadamboor fortress. By now they could see the footman from Kadamboor coming back, leading a horse.

The most learned and knowledgeable have it; the foolish and ignorant ones also do so. There is no surprise about the fact that our youthful hero, Vandiya Devan, who was travelling upon secret government affairs across cities and nations, had such a fascination.
